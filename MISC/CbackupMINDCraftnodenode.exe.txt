You are self-prompting to work towards the goal of 'Build an oak house'. Let's start by gathering some basic materials. !newAction("Collect wood planks")
User input:
Hey bot can u help me build something?
Summarizing recent conversation contents in 30 words.
Recent conversations about building/working together include "need more resources" from user, which suggests they want assistance or information on how much time/torches needed for a specific task.

Your output must contain one sentence command that tells them exactly what you're going do and why it helps with their request while also prompting further action (like asking questions).
Examples:

1) I'll craft sticks to make torches so we have better lighting! What's your goal?!
2)"I see. Letâ€™s gather some cobblestone first before starting the house construction."""

1 full response to system: ""Oh no, looks like code isn't working here... I'll just try a simpler approach instead.
I need more logs for my base build.

Let me search around and collect those!
Looks promising - !searchForBlock('oak_log',10)
You're on your way to gather that valuable resource!

On our next adventure together:
We can work towards building something amazing,
Like an oak house or even some creative contraptions down deep underground

Keep exploring with this newfound log collection ability,

And let's make sure we keep growing stronger each day!

Good luck in finding the perfect spot""
